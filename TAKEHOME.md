# Take-Home Exercise
## Design a Resilient Large-File Upload & Data Preview Experience

- **Role focus:** Frontend-leaning full-stack engineer
- **Product type:** Data-heavy user interfaces
- **Timebox:** ~3 hours
- **AI tools:** Allowed and expected

## Context

Users upload large CSV files (10-100MB) into a data analysis tool.

Because the application runs on serverless infrastructure, request size limits apply. To work around this, the app uses a client-side chunked upload approach.

A basic implementation already exists, but the user experience and state handling are fragile. This exercise focuses on designing a trustworthy, resilient frontend workflow around chunked uploads and providing a clear data preview for non-technical users.

This is not an infrastructure exercise. We are interested in frontend systems thinking, UX under constraints, and good judgment.

## What's Provided

The starter project includes:

- A Next.js App Router application
- Local API routes for uploads (no database, no auth)
- A basic chunked upload implementation
- An upload UI
- A simple data preview UI
- Local storage of uploaded chunks and assembled files

Everything runs locally with no external services.

## Your Task

### 1. Improve the upload experience (UX)

Design a clear, user-trustworthy upload workflow.
Think in explicit phases, for example:

`Select -> Validate -> Upload (chunked) -> Finalize -> Ready`

Your solution should:

- Communicate progress users can trust
- Clearly explain what's happening at each stage
- Handle errors with actionable messaging
- Support retry in a sensible way
- Avoid showing "success" before the upload is truly complete

Assume users are non-technical.

### 2. Improve client-side robustness

The existing chunking logic is intentionally simple.

Improve it to better handle:

- Chunk orchestration and ordering
- State transitions (avoid "boolean soup")
- Partial failure (e.g., a chunk fails mid-upload)
- Cancellation or restart behavior
- Safe retry assumptions from a frontend perspective

A perfect solution is not required. Focus on clarity, correctness, and reasonable tradeoffs.

### 3. Improve the data preview surface

After upload, users should be able to sanity-check their data.

Improve or extend the preview UI so that it:

- Handles wide datasets (20-100 columns)
- Is readable for non-technical users
- Surfaces schema or data issues early
- Prioritizes clarity over completeness

No design mocks are provided intentionally.
We want to see your judgment and UX instincts.

A minimal solution is completely acceptable (e.g., first N rows, column list, inferred types).

### 4. Document your decisions

Add a short `DECISIONS.md` (or a section in the `README`) covering:

- What you changed and why
- What you intentionally did not do
- Tradeoffs you made
- What you would ask the backend for next (if anything)

Treat this like a real production PR.

## Constraints

- **Timebox:** ~3 hours (please do not overbuild)
- **AI assistants:** allowed and expected
- **Backend:** assume provided API routes work as documented
- **Infrastructure:** do not redesign storage or introduce cloud services
- **Testing:** optional

We care far more about judgment and clarity than polish.

## Optional Extensions (choose at most one)

Only if time permits:

- Resumable uploads
- Chunk-level retry with backoff
- Cancel or pause uploads
- Improved progress accuracy (bytes vs chunks)
- Schema validation or column mapping UX
- Accessibility improvements
- Performance improvements (e.g., table rendering)

Choosing what not to do is part of the exercise.

## What We're Evaluating

### Judgment & product sense (highest priority)

- Did you focus on the right problems?
- Is the UX calm, clear, and trustworthy?
- Are tradeoffs explicit and reasonable?

### Frontend architecture

- Clear state model
- Predictable side effects
- Sensible component boundaries

### Data-heavy UI instincts

- Preview is usable for wide data
- Schema issues are surfaced early
- Information density is handled thoughtfully

### Full-stack awareness

- Reasonable assumptions about backend behavior
- Clear separation of frontend vs backend responsibility
- Pragmatic backend "asks" (not hacks)

### Communication

- Clear explanations
- Honest limitations
- Evidence of restraint

## Important Note on AI

You may use AI tools.
We are not evaluating raw code output; we are evaluating decisions, clarity, and judgment.

Strong submissions explain why something exists, not just how.

## Submission

Please share:

- A link to your repo (or a zip)
- Brief instructions to run it
- Your `DECISIONS.md`

We'll follow up with a short review call to walk through one decision and discuss what you would do next.

## Final Note

This exercise mirrors real-world work on data-heavy products under constraints.

Keep it pragmatic, focused, and honest.

We're excited to see how you think.
